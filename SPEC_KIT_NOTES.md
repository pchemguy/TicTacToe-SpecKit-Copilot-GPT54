# Spec Kit Dev Highlights

> [!WARNING] plan.md got truncated by autofix.
> 
> - IMPORTANT: autofix removed all additional files that get appended to plan.md own contents (data-model.md quickstart.md research.md app-orchestration.md computer-strategy.md game-core.md).

This project has a well developed phased decomposition of the target feature development. See

- [spec](spec.md)
- [plan](specs/001-add-tictactoe-ai/plan.md)
- [research](research.md)
- [tasks](specs/001-add-tictactoe-ai/tasks.md)
- [task-to-issue](task-to-issue.md)
- [data-model](data-model.md)

## Constitution

- Consider introducing constitution examples into Spec Kit project and using [constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md) as an example (*Obsidian.md will not open this link in a dotted directory*).
- [x] Need to add documentation development section incorporating simultaneous docs development by task decomposition and implementation agents; possibly also to checklist or something to add QA control as well.

## Task to Issue Mapping

- Use [task-to-issue](task-to-issue.md) as the basis for creating `speckit.taskstoissues` template for saving the mapping
- Integrate [taskstoissues](taskstoissues.md) into `speckit.taskstoissues`.
- IMPORTANT: Remove the `tools:` YAML key from `speckit.taskstoissues`. This key, if present, is a white list, and disables all tools not explicitly named. As result, GitHub interaction get crippled, as well as the ability to create on-disk files.

## Implement

- Integrate [implement](implement.md) (with conditionals on available labels/milestones/mapping, which must be created by patched `speckit.taskstoissues`) into `speckit.implement`. Note: missing instructions to close completed milestones.

## Feature Decomposition

- Consider [spec](spec.md), [plan](specs/001-add-tictactoe-ai/plan.md), [specify](specify.md), [plan](docs/plan.md) (see warning above), and current Spec Kit `specify` and `plan` prompts with the goal to extend these prompts for improved decomposition workflows.
- `speckit.plan` dumps/appends contents of additional file (in this case, data-model.md quickstart.md research.md app-orchestration.md computer-strategy.md game-core.md) inside plan.md. Check prompt logic. This is not the right thing to do. plan.md must remain as such. If creating a merged file actually makes sense, it should be a separate file with clear note upfront.

## Analyze Auto Fix

- Introduce `speckit.analyzetoautofix` to perform automatic resolution of issues identified by `speckit.analyze`.
- Extend `speckit.analyze` to create issues report as a file.
- See
    - [analysis-report](analysis-report.md)
    - [analysis-resolution-plan](analysis-resolution-plan.md)
    - [analysis-resolution-report](analysis-resolution-report.md)
    - [speckit.analyzetoautofix.agent.md](.github/agents/speckit.analyzetoautofix.agent.md) (*Obsidian.md will not open this link in a dotted directory*)

> [!WARNING] Autofix Review
> 
> Review autofix results! In this project, `plan.md` got truncated by autofix (possibly ok, see warning above). 

## UI Spec

Need a dedicated agent / means for developing UI specification / design or some strategy.
